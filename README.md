This is a [Backbone.js](http://backbonejs.org) application I threw together as part of a presentation I did at
[The Armory Workspace](http://www.thearmoryworkspace.com/).  The end result is a web-based
[Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) editor written using Backbone.js.

### Disclaimer
As I said above, I threw this together and it was to be used solely as presentation materials.  That being said,
I didn't write this to actually be consumed.  I don't think it would take much to turn this into a useable
application but I figured I'd throw this out there.  Here are known places where I focused more on presentation
and less on people actually using this application:

* I mixed the way to create/load templates using Underscore.js (The purpose of this was to explain to the
attendees that they have flexibility in how the create and use templates)
* I put all of the JavaScript pieces in one file instead of breaking them out as necessary and using something
like [Require.js](http://requirejs.org) to put the pieces together
* I focused more on readible code instead of best practices
* I created the least possible server component for this
* I mixed [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/) and JavaScript for demonstration purposes

All of this being said, if anyone is interested in turning this into a real *thing*, I'd love to help and I'd
also welcome the help.  While there are a handle of things I'd do different if I originally planned on writing
this for public consumption, I still think this project is a good starting point and could be turned into
something useful.
